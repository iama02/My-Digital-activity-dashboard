##  ➡️ Chart Descriptions:

### Chart 1: Messages and Emails Over 100 Days
  
Shows the number of messages and emails sent over 100 days. Helps track communication trends and daily digital interactions.

### Chart 2: Digital Activity – Screen Time Over 100 Days

Displays daily screen time across 100 days. Useful for analyzing usage patterns and identifying peak device usage periods.

### Chart 3: Distribution of Websites Visited

Visualizes which websites were accessed most frequently. Helps understand browsing behavior and digital preferences.

### Chart 4: Emails Sent vs Emails Received

Compares the number of emails sent against received. Useful for tracking communication balance and responsiveness.

### Chart 5: Correlation Heatmap of Digital Activities
  
Shows the correlation between different digital activities (e.g., messages, screen time, websites). Helps identify patterns and relationships.

### Chart 6: Active Browsing Hours
 
Displays the distribution of active browsing hours throughout the day. Highlights peak browsing periods.

### Chart 7: Correlation Between Numerical Digital Activities

Analyzes the relationship between numerical metrics like messages, emails, and screen time. Useful for spotting dependencies between activities.
